            Currently working on a sign language interpreter using deep learning.</p>
           <p> This project involves using a convolution neural network to interpret static gestures for the start.
            It could later evolve to the use of a recurrent neural network to read dynamic gestures.

          <p>I also do some car wiring part time. I started at a garage in Katwe around August 2019.</p>
          <p>I was an intern at Microfuse Computer Technologies from June to August 2018. It was a start-up company that specialised in electronics design. We leant how to use tools like Autodesk Eagle and SOLIDWORKS. </p>
          <p>I also had an internship stint with iLabs Makerere which was focused on embedded systems design using Arduino microcontrollers.</p>
          <p>I also have some marketing experience during my time at GNLD International which was dealing in food supplements and homecare poducts. I was also involved in training new recruits on product knowledge, motivating them and giving marketing tips.</p>
